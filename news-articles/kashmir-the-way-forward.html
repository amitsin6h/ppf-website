            <p style="font-size: 20px; color: #2c2c2c;">It is indeed heartening to note that after around 75 days of turmoil Kashmir valley seems to be slowly limping back to normalcy. However, one has to keep the fingers crossed hoping that good sense will prevail among the people behind this turmoil with realisation of large scale losses of precious lives, property, livelihood and loss to economy and sufferings of people in the state.<br><br>

            In his address to the nation on 'Mann Ki Baat' on September 25, PM referred to the situation in Kashmir and mentioned that Kashmiris are beginning to recognise well the true face of anti- national forces. Highlighting the importance of peace, unity and harmony for attaining progress and development, he expressed optimism  in finding solutions to the problems to pave way for future generations in Kashmir.<br><br>

            This statement of the PM may provide solace to the peace loving constituency in Kashmir and also reassuring to people in the country. However, looking into the complexities of problem and machinations of various anti national forces within the valley and across the border, the optimism envisioned by the PM  looks a tall order, easier said than done. To attain this, the political leadership may have to tread on a cautious path taking into consideration the sensitivities of the people not only in the valley, but all the three regions of the state. The roadmap to be drawn should be a well considered vision document focused on long term developmental plan and not a short term knee- jerk reaction as has been the case in the past.<br><br>

            In this context it has to be realised that the external factor, bedevilling the situation in Kashmir with state sponsored terrorism, particularly for the last over 25 years, is beyond our control. However, the internal dimension of the problem   Is something which has be taken care of by the Union and the State governments.This would call for a deep introspection and soul searching into various omissions and commissions by the political leadership over the years leading to huge trust deficit among sizeable section of people in the valley.<br><br>

            This trust deficit in the mind of Kashmiris has been fully exploited by elements across the border for the last over 25 years. Significantly, the complexion of uprising has undergone a change in the recent crisis and the movement of 'azadi' has transcended human rights issues. This uprising is run by a new post 1990 generation :'the children of conflict', highly suspicious of customary peace talk with clear body language of 'we don't want to be a part of India'. So the need for a visionary initiative to win back the hears of people in Kashmir.<br><br>

            As far as handling of Kashmir situation is concerned, the general impression is that hitherto the main focus of the Government has been on conflict management rather than conflict resolution. It has to be realised that it may not be possible to contain the situation and bring about normalcy in Kashmir only by the Security forces and Army. On the contrary, it adds to the trust deficit leading to large scale alienation of people, a serious problem warranting due consideration.<br><br>

            Lack of any serious initiative by the Union Govt towards integration of people in Kashmir with rest of the country has contributed significantly towards the trust deficit. Kashmir valley is separated from rest of the country with high altitude Pir Panjal range with no connectivity by rail or any all weather highway for people to travel out of the valley. As a result, a very small percentage of Kashmiris have travelled out of the state. High speed train connectivity and all weather highway will not only contribute toward integration of people of Kashmir with rest of the country, but would also provide the basic infrastructure for any developmental activity.<br><br>

            As far as infrastructure for developmental activities are concerned, shortage of power in the state is another major constraint. At present availability of power in the valley in summer months is around 16 to 18 hrs in urban areas and 13 to 14 hrs in the rural areas,  but in winter months availability is just about 8 to 10 hours. In any long term developmental plan, establishment of industries in the state would need to acquire high priority and this would call for manifold enhancement in availability of power in the state.<br><br>

            Lack of employment opportunities is a major contributory factor with the youth falling prey to the exhortations of anti national elements and playing the role of mercenary stone peters. Taking the skill development programme forward in a major way and setting up large number of small and medium scale industries in different parts of the state may ease the situation to some extent. Significantly, most of the stone peters may be seen queuing up in line in case of any recruitment in Army, Security Forces and Police. Some of the sanctioned posts in these organisations are still not filled.<br><br>

            With the leadership of present uprising being in the hands of misguided youth, whose mindset is conditioned by adverse propaganda against India and in support of global jihad, there is a need to have a proper eduction policy in the state. The state has nearly 14 lakhs school going children, but for sheer want of proper schools providing formal education, a large number of them are  exposed to teachings in 'madrasas'. There is a need to have a state run proper school in every village in a phased manner. Even in the text booms of state run schools there is no chapter on India's stand on Kashmir and irrelevance of UN resolution. The HRD Ministry in Union govt and the State Education department need to look into it.<br><br>

            Lastly, the issue of lack of consistency in government policy vis a vis J&K. Even on issues like dialogue with Hurriyat leaders or engagement with Pakistan the decision is based on knee jerk reaction. There is a need to have an effective mechanism to deliberate and delineate a long term policy. In the present arrangement the subject is dealt with by MHA,which has a huge responsibility besides J&K affairs. As such, the Joint Secretary handling the subject becomes the key decision maker in the normal period.Considering the importance of Kashmir issue, the suggestion of having a Department of Kashmir Affairs within the MHA manned by officers knowledgeable in this field deserves consideration. This body may be assisted in policy formulation by a think tank comprising experienced and right thinking people from all the three regions of the state besides knowledgeable persons having served in J&K in civil services, security forces, defence services, intelligence organisations as also technocrats.<br><br>
            To sum up, a clear cut visionary policy of Union government with full backing of state government focussing on development of J&K, welfare of people and integration of Kashmir with rest of the country is called for.<br><br>
