             It is indeed very heartening to note that NDRF, which is the youngest Central Police organisation in the country, has in a short span of 10 years, acquired a niche for itself for its professionalism in handling disaster situations. It is a multi-disciplinary, multi-skill, high tech specialist force capable of handling all natural disasters and CBRN emergencies. It has also acquired the unique distinction of being the single largest dedicated disaster response force in the world.<br><br>

              The NDRF journey, since its inception to its present shape, has been a steep uphill task with innumerable impediments and overcoming the same has been a daunting experience. But first a few words about its inception. As the DG CISF, I had the privilege of being a Member of the Steering Committee headed by the then Union Home Secretary in 2003, constituted to decide the format of disaster response mechanism in the country. Full credit for the grandiose vision of having 8 Bns of NDRF drawn from four CPOs goes to Shri RK Singh, the then Joint Secretary, Disaster Management and the Secretary of the Steering Committee. He not only conceived the concept of NDRF, but got the Cabinet approval for â‚¹ 290 crores  for 310 equipments for each of the proposed 8 Bns of NDRF. He was also responsible for drafting the Disaster Management Act 2005, which enjoined upon the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) the responsibility of superintendence, direction and control of the NDRF.<br><br>

              Shortly after constitution of the NDMA, a meetings with the four DGs (BSF, CRPF, CISF & ITBP) was convened under the chairmanship of the Vice Chairman in Oct, 2005 to seek their support to set up the force (NDRF) by providing the personnel sanctioned for each of the 8 Bns. The lukewarm response of the DGs to extend the desired support made us to realise that establishing this force would be a difficult task. While the efforts to get the support of the DGs were on, a missive from the Army Hqr came as yet another blow. It was a very cogently drafted proposal from Army Hqr, received in the NDMA through MOD & MHA, staking claim for all the 8 NDRF Bns being given to Army. The argument was that since Army has vast experience of handling disasters, it would be able to provide experienced personnel from all disciplines to establish the NDRF and make all the 8 Bns fully functional within six months. Notwithstanding the merit in the proposal of Army Hqr vis a vis the impediments and limitations to set up this force with personnel from CPOs, NDMA argued the case vehemently in support of CPOs. After protracted correspondence for months, this issue was finally clinched in favour of CPOs with the argument that NDRF is a statutory force under Sec 44 & 45 of the DM Act and if NDRF is given to Army, it will be the first instance of Army being given a statutory role in matters relating to internal security. It was further contended that even after constitution of NDRF, Army will still be requisitioned in any major disaster as aid to civil authorities.<br><br>

              The next hurdle was various problems relating to procurement of 310 equipments for which there was neither any QR and nor wherewithal for procurement. Since most of the 310 equipments were new items for which no QR was available with any organisation, NDMA engaged the services of Maj Gen (Retd) Mukherjee (former ADG, Weapons & Equipment, Army Hqr) and constituted a committee under him which produced a voluminous document with detailed QRs of all the 310 equipments after a painstaking efforts of six months. Next problem came up with the the Procurement Division of MHA declining to accept the huge responsibility of procurement of  the 310 equipments for each the 8 NDRF Bns. DG NDRF was handicapped in undertaking this responsibility as he had no sanctioned staff for NDRF Hqr. The four CPO Chiefs also declined to take up this responsibility. After exhausting all options, NDMA engaged the services of Ms Somi Tandon, who had retired as Secretary / FA in MOD and had vast experience in the field of procurement. The committee set up under Ms Somi Tandon, after detailed deliberations, distributed the 310 items under two categories of low value and high value. It recommended that the low value items may be procured by the  Commandants of respective Bns under their delegated powers.  The remaining  high value items were distributed under four different heads with the responsibility of procurement under each of the four heads assigned to the four CPOs. The four DGs were persuaded to accept this responsibility which they accepted grudgingly. Realising that procurement of all the equipments was critical towards effective operationalisation of the NDRF, NDMA monitored this process very closely and ensured that most of the procurement was completed by around 2008.<br><br>

              Equally important factor towards effective operationalisation of NDRF as a professional force was availability of manpower and their proper training. As per the Cabinet approval each NDRF Bn was authorised 1145 personnel, but since the CPOs had their own priorities and constraints of manpower, availability of manpower in each of the NDRF Bns remained abysmal. The problem was worse compounded because skeleton manpower available in each of the NDRF Bns was being diverted regularly for routine law & order and IS duties directly by  the MHA, sometimes even withdrawing the personnel mid way from various Disaster Response trainings. In a series of meetings in the MHA, even with the Hon'ble HM, NDMA impressed on the importance of training of NDRF personnel and their ready availability for response during any disaster. However, MHA would invariably scuttle it with the contention of shortage of manpower for IS duties, maintaining that the NDRF personnel withdrawn for law & order duties  would be made available as and when there is any disaster. Finally, in one of the meetings in early 2007,  Hon'ble HM agreed that NDRF would be a dedicated force for disaster response only and directed the NDMA to send a proposal accordingly to frame the Rules for NDRF.  Draft for NDRF Rules was accordingly sent to MHA by NDMA around mid 2007, but thereafter there was no feedback from MHA on the fate of this draft. Follow up enquiry on this issue by the NDMA brought out that MHA had sent it to the Ministry of Law for Hindi translation and Gazette notification. Informal enquiry from the Ministry of Law brought out that MHA had changed the draft rule mentioning that "at any point of time 50% of NDRF personnel may be deployed by the MHA for law & order duties".  This change, if incorporated in the NDRF rules, would have been a catastrophe for this force as in the normal course, 15 to 20 % posts in the Forces remain vacant and 25 to 30 % are on leave or training. If MHA was authorised to divert 50 % of the sanctioned posts, the actual availability of manpower in respective NDRF Bns would have been reduced to 5 to 10 % only and this force would have been no better than Civil Defence or Home Guards. It was a very disturbing situation with the fate of this force in total jeopardy.<br><br>

              In this situation of helplessness, there was no option left but to approach the then NSA Shri MK Narayanan to intervene in the interest of destiny of this force. Luckily, around the same time Hon'ble PM had convened a meeting of NDMA on October 25, 2007 in which besides NDMA Vice Chairman and Members, Home Minister, Finance Minister, Pr Secretary to PM, Home Secretary etc were the invitees. Although NSA was not an invitee to the meeting, it was after tremendous persuasion that he agreed to participate in the same. In this  meeting with Hon'ble PM, issues  relating to NDRF was not discussed as it was not in the agenda. However, since the NSA was fully briefed on this issue, towards the end of the meeting, he made a very strong case for NDRF suggesting that it should be 'a stand alone' force for disaster response only on the lines of NSG. He further mentioned that the NDRF 'personnel should be on deputation to NDMA and would not form part of the MHA's general reserve as additional force for law and order situations' Hon'ble PM approved NSA's suggestion. We felt that the issue was clinched, but this happiness was short lived in the sense that NSA's suggestion was dropped from the minutes of the meeting at the behest of MHA on the ground that NSA was not an invitee to this meeting. I once again approached the NSA with this draft minutes of the meeting. A look at this minutes convinced the NSA of magnitude of problems NDMA was faced with in setting up this force. He immediately issued a letter dated 14th November, 2007 quoting his suggestions, already approved by Hon'ble PM in the meeting and adding that the minutes should be redrafted accordingly. Ultimately, it was this letter of the NSA that clinched the issue finally leading to Gazette notification of NDRF rules as a dedicated force on deputation to NDMA on 14th February 2008. Needless to mention that but for pro-active initiative of the NDMA and whole heated support of the NSA at crucial junctures in framing the NDRF rules, this force would not have been what it is today.<br><br>

              In terms of teething troubles in effective operationalisation of NDRF at the ground level in the initial years, a major problem was to carry conviction with the state governments to use this unknown force during floods and other disasters. The states were used to requisitioning the services of Army during any disaster as they had confidence in their capability to handle the same. Therefore, they continued with the practice of requisitioning Army, paying no heed to NDRF despite its teams being deployed at disaster sites. Another  significant development was that in order to preempt NDRF's deployment, the local units of Army started rushing their columns to the disaster sites, even without being requisitioned by the local authorities . To overcome this problem of mindset of the state authorities, NDMA came up with two concepts related to deployment of NDRF. Firstly, 'pre-positioning' NDRF teams in sufficient numbers at likely disasters sites based on IMD weather forecast. Secondly, in case of disasters with no advance warning, 'pro-active' deployment of NDRF teams at disaster sites with utmost promptitude without awaiting approval for deployment from NDMA/ NDRF Hqr. A few other initiatives taken by the NDMA to acquaint the state and district authorities about the capabilities of NDRF included organising exhibitions and demonstrations by NDRF of its capabilities and resources mainly at state capitals and conducting community capacity building and awareness generation programmes relating to different disasters at district and block levels in states.<br><br>

              While multi-pronged initiatives were on to ensure acceptability of NDRF by the states, a major breakthrough came in terms of breach of the Kosi embankment near Indo-Nepal border and resultant massive flood in  Bihar in August 2008. This massive flood could have led to huge devastation as there was no unit of NDRF in Bihar. However,  as soon as the news of breach in Kosi  barrage came to notice on 19th August 2008, NDMA directed two nearby Bns to despatch 13 motorised boats with 130 personnel which reached the affected site with utmost promptitude on 20th August. Thereafter, for the next one week the skeleton team of officers in the NDMA remained in round the clock contact with the Bihar government mobilising motorised boats from the factory in Noida and personnel from different Bns and airlifting the same directly to Purnea. Notwithstanding limited resources of NDRF in this initial phase , as many as 175 motorised boats and around 1700 personnel were deployed evacuating 1,05,000 affected people. But for very prompt and professional response from NDRF, thousands of lives  would have been lost in this devastating flood. Impressed by the professionalism of NDRF, Bihar CM Shri Nitish Kumar wrote a complimentary letter to Hon'ble PM on 27th August 2008 requesting for sanction of a NDRF Bn for Bihar and offering land free of cost to NDRF at prime location near Patna. Taking cue from this, the Andhra Pradesh CM Shri Rajsekhar Reddy also wrote a letter with similar request to Hon'ble PM. Complimentary letters to Hon'ble PM from CMs of two important states brought the NDRF to limelight for its professionalism and it never looked backward since then. The proposals from the two  CMs were examined by PMO and MHA in consultation with NDMA and in 2009 it was decided to sanction  two NDRF Bns in Bihar and Andhra Pradesh immediately in phase I and two more Bns in Uttarakhand and North East later in phase II.<br><br>

              While most of the major teething problems of NDRF in its formative stages, as mentioned above, were sorted out in the first 3/4 years, certain equally important issues crucial to the force like land and infrastructure for each of the Bns, training in handling different types of disasters including CBRN emergencies, a state of art training institute in disaster response and staff for the NDRF Hqr  etc have all been handled with reasonable degree of satisfaction. A significant  impediment in planned growth of the force was postings of DGs with short tenures : as many as 13 DGs between 2006 to 2013. However, this issue was sorted out with posting of Shri O.P Singh with a tenure of nearly two years, who has since been succeeded by Shri Pachnanda. This has not only brought stability with long term vision to the force, but has also changed the profile of NDRF significantly.<br><br>

              As the founder Member of NDMA entrusted with responsibility of raising this force from scratch, it gives me immense satisfaction to see that this force has earned a name for itself for its professionalism in handling disasters not only within the country, but also abroad. Commendable work done by the NDRF in the triple-disaster at Fukushima (Japan) in March 2011 and in the Nepal earthquake in April 2015 will remain the high water mark of professionalism of this force. The NDRF will remain beholden to Gen (Retd) NC Vij, Vice Chairman, NDMA and Shri P.K Mishra , first Secretary of NDMA for their whole hearted support in its formative stages and also to NSA Shri MK Narayan for providing much needed support at the highest level at crucial stages. The painstaking efforts of Shivaji Singh, R.K Sinha, Dr Kumar Raka, Vijay Lomish and other members of NDMA and NDRF Hqr has contributed immensely in making this force what it is today. NDRF is now poised for high trajectory growth and we wish best of luck to this force in its future endeavours.
